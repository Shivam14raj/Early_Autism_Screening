# Early Autism Detection ML System 🧠

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline for early autism screening using machine learning techniques. The project focuses on data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter optimization, evaluation, and prediction using a trained classification model.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can help in timely intervention and support. This project develops a machine learning classification system that predicts ASD likelihood based on behavioral screening responses and demographic features.

The project implements a complete ML workflow from raw data processing to model prediction.

# 📊 Machine Learning Workflow

## 1. Data Preprocessing

Performed preprocessing steps:

- Converted data types
- Removed unnecessary columns:
  - ID
  - age_desc
- Corrected inconsistent categorical values
- Handled missing/unknown categorical values
- Applied Label Encoding
- Detected and handled outliers using IQR method

---

## 2. Handling Class Imbalance

The dataset contained imbalanced target classes.

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) was applied on training data to improve model learning.

---

## 3. Model Training

Multiple classification algorithms were evaluated:

| Model | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Decision Tree | Baseline classifier |
| Random Forest | Ensemble learning |
| XGBoost | Gradient boosting approach |

---

## 4. Hyperparameter Optimization

RandomizedSearchCV was used to find optimal parameters for each model.

The final model was selected based on cross-validation performance.

---

# 🏆 Final Model

The best performing model:

```
Random Forest Classifier
```

Best Parameters:

```text
n_estimators = 50
max_depth = 20
bootstrap = False
random_state = 42
```

---

# 📈 Model Performance

Cross-validation Accuracy:

```
92.52%
```

Evaluation metrics used:

- Accuracy

# 💾 Saved Model Artifacts

After training, the following files are generated:

```
models/

├── autism_model.pkl
└── encoders.pkl
```

`autism_model.pkl`
- Contains the trained Random Forest model.

`encoders.pkl`
- Contains Label Encoders required for transforming new input data.
